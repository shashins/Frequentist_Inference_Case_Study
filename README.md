# Frequentist Inference Case Study

There are two parts to the case study. In part A, we apply Pythonic implementation of the concepts underlying frequentist inference. In Part B, we apply those implementations to a real-world scenario. 

We implementing the following concepts as we work through the case study:

The z-statistic

The t-statistic

The Central Limit Theorem

Estimation of the population standard deviation and mean, from a sample

Sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean

Calculating confidence intervals and p-values

Hypothesis testing
