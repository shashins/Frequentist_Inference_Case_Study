# Frequentist Inference Case Study

In this case study, you’ll learn more about frequentist inference. There are two parts to the case study. In part A, you’ll learn the Pythonic implementation of the concepts underlying frequentist inference. In Part B, you’ll apply those implementations to a real-world scenario. 

You’ll be implementing the following concepts as you work through the case study:

The z-statistic
The t-statistic
The Central Limit Theorem
Estimation of the population standard deviation and mean, from a sample
Sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
Calculating confidence intervals and p-values
Hypothesis testing
